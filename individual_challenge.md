# Individual Challenge: KitchenOps !!! 

You have been recently hired to run your restaurant's KitchenOps program.  The restaurant is so close to its 5th Michelin star, you can taste it!

One way to attain that 5th star is to deliver consistently perfect results in meal preparation.  This means having complete control over:
* Oven, stovetop, and grill temperature settings
* Shelflife of the freshest ingredients (and the soup!)
* Consistency of food preparation times per meal time
* and more.

Being in the 4-star tier, this restaurant has recently invested in IoT telemetry to track these sorts of things, and the restaurant owner's IT person has already created a set of library panels for these sensors. 

All we have to do is present them in a way that is easy for the kitchen staff to understand and attractive enough -  if they were to peek into the kitchen - for an anonymous Michelin inspector to notice! 

At the end of this exercise, everyone will vote on who has the best dashboard (you cannot vote for your own dashboard).  Please *name your team* so that everyone knows who to vote for....good luck!

A couple of kitchen standards:
1. While ground spices are typically replaced at 6 months and other spices should be replaced every 2-4 years, this kitchen tries to keep spices for no more than *4 months* - when they remember.
 
2. The grill needs to kept at *387 degrees*, plus or minus 7 degrees for our signature "Bodacious Burger"

3. We need to track how long each chef cooks our signature, pan-seared "Choice Coho (Salmon)".  Since we individually choose each salmon fillet for consistent thickness, freshness and quality, we are still getting inconsistent ratings from our guests.  Each side needs to be cooked for *150 seconds* - no more, no less.

4. The refrigerator needs to stay between *35 and 38 degrees*.  Some unknown chef has nightmares from a former food safety violation when their previous restaurant's temperature was found to be 41 degress (a food safety violation) and now keeps turning down the temperature, making the eggs freeze on occasion.

5. The lobster mac n' cheese is so popular that one of the ovens is now the dedicated "MacOven".  It stays at *375 degrees* for best results but can vary 25 degrees in either direction.

6. Our restaurant's multicolor mood lighting is incredible. Let's make sure 100% of the lights are working.

7. Let's make sure the room temperature is 70 degrees (F) in all 8 zones of our dining rooms.  We don't want our guests to suffer the chill below 69 or a heat above 71 degrees Farenheit.


## Directions
**Prerequisite**: We first need to import the `Dashboard Makeover Challenge` dashboard.
Steps to Import:
1. Click the menu button (â˜°) at the top left, and then click on *Dashboards*.
2. On the Dashboards screen, click the *New* button and then click *Import*.
3. On the Import Dashboard screen, in the *Import via grafana.com* field, type in `16415` and then click *Load*.
4. You will be asked to choose three of your dashboard's data sources:
    -  For TestData DB, choose `TestData DB`.
    - For Google Sheets, choose `Google Sheets`.
    - You will also notice that library panels will be imported automatically.
    - Click on *Import*.
  
Using this dashboard as a starting point, and using the techniques you learned from the workshop, create the best dashboard possible and send the results to your Extreme Dashboard Makeover host.  The top dashboard will win some cool Grafana swag.

For inspiration, you can import dashboard `16417`.

Good Luck!!!
